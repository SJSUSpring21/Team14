Idea 1: sMPC for wage gap analysis 
Whether its a race to get COVID vaccine developed or race to open businesses safely, its all about data sharing between government and private entities without compromising privacy of our citizen. There are technologies such as Secured Multi-party computation (sMPC), differential privacy and other techniques that enable privacy preserved data sharing. 
Wage gap is seen in almost every industry. A centralized analysis of data helps us understand the root causes of wage gap and helps pave way towards 100% equal work and equal pay. As this is sensitive information, sMPC will help us to ensure privacy and security of data collected based on race, religion, gender, ethnicity etc.

Idea 2: Creating a dashboard for legal immigrants that can help answer questions such as: 
what are the chances of a H1B visa being denied?
What will be the impact on a certain industry if H1B Visa is eliminated?
What will be the benefit to US economy if US implements time bond citizenship for immigrant workers? 

Idea 3: Idea: Justice on wheels
Access to Legal services in India is very limited, especially in rural areas. In many cases, long running justice process and expensive legal help deter people even to seek justice. A Justice on wheels app(with lawyers network) that provides mobile (at your doorstep ) service for:
•	Affidavit and stamp papers related work.
•	Will and trust
•	Legal rights education
•	Consumer protection related services and others
This “On wheels” idea can be applied to Tutoring, Books and stationary selling.
“Accounting on wheels” can be another opportunity as there are tons of BCOM boys and girls in India looking for work. The company will train them on business and financial accounting
