sMPC for wage gap analysis:  

Whether its a race to get COVID vaccine developed or race to open businesses safely, its all about data sharing between government and private entities without compromising privacy of our citizen. There are technologies such as Secured Multi-party computation (sMPC), differential privacy and other techniques that enable privacy preserved data sharing. 

Wage gap is seen in almost every industry. A centralized analysis of data helps us understand the root causes of wage gap and helps pave way towards 100% equal work and equal pay. As this is sensitive information, sMPC will help us to ensure privacy and security of data collected based on race, religion, gender, ethnicity etc.
